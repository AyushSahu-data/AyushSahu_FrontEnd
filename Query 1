Q. Explain what the simple List component does

Ans - In ReactJS, the Simple List component is a reusable and modular UI element that can be easily integrated into any React application to display
a collection of items as a list.
It is a powerful and flexible tool for displaying lists of data in a clear and organized way.

The code  is a React component that represents a List with selectable items. It is composed of two sub-components, the SingleListItem and the ListComponent.The
SingleListItem is responsible for rendering each item of the list as a single li element. It takes in several props, including the index of the item,
whether or not it is selected, a click handler function, and the text to display. The ListComponent is responsible for rendering the entire list of items.
It takes in an array of items as a prop and maps over them to create a SingleListItem for each item. It also maintains the state of the currently selected item 
using the useState hook.Whenever the items array changes, the useEffect hook is triggered, which sets the selected index to null to ensure that no item is selected
by default. When a user clicks on a list item, the handleClick function is called, which updates the selected index state to the index of the clicked item. 
This causes the isSelected prop of the corresponding SingleListItem to be set to true, highlighting the item in green.Finally, the List component is exported
as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other React components.
